This directory is added to your PATH when you import ironclad.

If you want to use extension modules which fail to include required DLLs
(such as matplotlib, which depends on -- but does not distribute -- 
msvcp71.dll), please acquire legitimate copies of the necessary files and 
place them in this folder.
