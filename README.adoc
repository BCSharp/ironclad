= Overview =

Ironclad's purpose is to allow IronPython to transparently import and use
compiled CPython extensions.

The original project https://code.google.com/p/ironclad is no longer
active. The last known version works with Python 2.6. The idea here is
to make it work with current version (2.7.x) of CPython and IronPython.

At the moment it does compile using up to date components, but errors
or fails most of the tests.
