Ironclad's build process deserves a brief discussion. On 32-bit Windows, it requires:

* ipy from IronPython r38340 (included in /ironpython)
* mingw (including gcc and make)
* pexports
* nasm
* .NET 2.0 Service Pack 1 (csc, specifically)
* Python 2.5
* msvcr71.dll (distributed with Python 2.5)

On 32-bit Linux, requirements are:

* ipy from IronPython r38340 (included in /ironpython)
* gcc and make
* objdump
* nasm
* "recent" Mono (with gmcs compiler)
* Python 2.5, with -dev package

Ironclad's build process is configured by the file Makefile.config in the top-level directory. Change the value of variables NET and OS appropriately.

Running make in the top-level directory should do the following:

* Run 'tools/generatepython25api.py' to create 'src/Python25Api.cs' from the contents of 'src/python25apicomponents/'
* Run 'tools/generatepython25mapper.py' to create various files in 'src' from the contents of 'src/python25mappercomponents/'
* Compile the contents of 'src/' to create 'build/ironclad.dll'
* Run 'tools/buildstub.py' to (eventually) create the stub library 'build/python25.dll' from an existing (real) python25.dll and the contents of 'stub/'

At this point, the project is built and may even be usable. However, make will also build some test data, and run several tests; we expect all these to pass.
