
32-BIT WINDOWS REQUIREMENTS:

* Python 2.6
* IronPython 2.6
* SCons 1.2.0
* mingw 5.16 (with gcc)
* nasm 2.01
* pexports 0.43
* .NET 2.0 Service Pack 1 (csc, specifically)
** note that Vista users need to install Vista SP1, or .NET 3.5,
   to get .NET 2.0 SP1


32-BIT LINUX REQUIREMENTS:

Most importantly:

* The time and inclination to fix issues #12 and #13 at
http://code.google.com/p/ironclad/issues/list (patches very very welcome).

Assuming you have the above, requirements should be approximately similar,
with appropriate substitutions.


BUILDING

Ironclad's build process is configured by 'SConstruct' in the top-
level directory. Go to the section marked PLATFORM-SPECIFIC GLOBALS,
and change anything that looks wrong for your system.

On win32, MSVCR90_DLL is of particular note: to find it on your system,
find a directory in windows/winsxs that starts with:

  x86_Microsoft.VC90.CRT_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_9.0.21022.8_

...and use the full path to the msvcr90.dll therein.

Having done the above, running 'scons' in the top-level directory,
from a cmd.exe shell, should build everything required by Ironclad.


TESTING

To actually run the tests, 'ipy runtests.py' in the top-level
directory. I have successfully used the following environment
on win32:

* Python 2.6.2 with site-packages:
    numpy 1.3.0
    scipy 0.7.1
    h5py 1.2.0
    pysvn 1.7.1
* IronPython 2.6 RC1 with site-packages:
    subprocess.py (by Jeff Hardy)
    csv.py (copied from Python26 Lib)
    sqlite3 (copied from Python26 Lib)
* IRONPYTHONPATH entries, in order:
    <IPY_DIR>\Lib
    <IPY_DIR>\Lib\site-packages
    <CPY_DIR>\Lib\site-packages
    <CPY_DIR>\Dlls

If you're actually using your installed Python26, you may prefer 
to copy various packages directly into IronPython's site-packages,
to ensure they don't interact nastily: for example, just having 
matplotlib installed will currently break parts of scipy when 
running under ironclad :(.
