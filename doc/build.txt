32-BIT WINDOWS REQUIREMENTS:

* Python 2.6
* SCons 1.2.0
* GCCXML 0.6.0
* IronPython 2.6 RC3
* pygccxml 1.0.0 accessible to ipy (**)
* mingw 5.16 with gcc
* nasm 2.01 installed into MinGW/bin
* pexports 0.43 installed into MinGW/bin
* .NET 2.0 Service Pack 1 (***)

Alternative versions of the above software may work, but have not
been tested.

(**) To make pygccxml work with ipy, you also need:
  * IronPython.Zlib.dll (by Jeff Hardy)
  * gzip.py from Python26 Lib
  * pyexpat.py from FePy, saved as Lib/xml/parsers/expat.py
  * xml.sax.expatreader.py from Python26 Lib

(***) note that Vista users need to install Vista SP1, or .NET 3.5,
  to get .NET 2.0 SP1

32-BIT LINUX REQUIREMENTS:

Most importantly:

* The time and inclination to fix issues #12 and #13 at
http://code.google.com/p/ironclad/issues/list (patches very very welcome).

Assuming you have the above, requirements should be approximately similar,
with appropriate substitutions.


BUILDING

Ironclad's build process is configured by 'SConstruct' in the top-
level directory. Go to the section marked PLATFORM-SPECIFIC GLOBALS,
and change anything that looks wrong for your system.

On win32, MSVCR90_DLL is of particular note: to find it on your system,
find a directory in windows/winsxs that starts with:

  x86_Microsoft.VC90.CRT_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_9.0.21022.8_

...and use the full path to the msvcr90.dll therein.

Having done the above, running 'scons' in the top-level directory,
from a cmd.exe shell, should build everything required by Ironclad.


TESTING

Run 'scons test' in the top-level directory. Unlike the rest of the build 
process, the test command inherits its environment from the system. I have
successfully used the following environment on win32:

* Python 2.6.2
* IronPython 2.6 RC2 with Jeff Hardy's IronPython.Zlib.dll, plus site-packages:
    subprocess.py (by Jeff Hardy)
    csv.py (from Python26 Lib)
    gzip.py (from Python26 Lib)
    sqlite3 (from Python26 Lib)
    numpy 1.3.0
    scipy 0.7.1
    h5py 1.2.0
    pysvn 1.7.1
* IRONPYTHONPATH entries, in order:
    <IPY_DIR>\Lib
    <IPY_DIR>\Lib\site-packages
    <CPY_DIR>\Dlls
