* ipy from IronPython 2.0b1
* mingw (including gcc and make)
* pexports
* nasm
* .NET 2.0 (csc, specifically)
* Python 2.5
* msvcr71.dll (distributed with Python 2.5)

Running make in the top-level directory should do the following:

* Run 'tools/generatepython25api.py' to create 'src/Python25Api.cs' from the contents of 'src/python25apicomponents/'
* Run 'tools/generatepython25mapper.py' to create various files in 'src' from the contents of 'src/python25mappercomponents/'
* Compile the contents of 'src/' to create 'build/ironclad.dll'
* Run 'tools/buildstub.py' to (eventually) create the stub library 'build/python25.dll' from an existing (real) python25.dll and the contents of 'stub/'

At this point, the project is built and may even be usable. However, make will also build some test data, and run several tests; we expect all these to pass.
