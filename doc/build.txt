Ironclad's build process deserves a brief discussion. 

32-BIT WINDOWS REQUIREMENTS:

* IronPython 2.0 final (2.0.0.0)
* mingw or cygwin (including gcc and make) 
* pexports
* nasm
* .NET 2.0 Service Pack 1 (csc, specifically)
** note that Vista users need to install Vista SP1 to get .NET 2.0 SP1
* Python 2.5

If you are using cygwin you should set the environment variable 
IRONCLAD_USE_CYGWIN to YES.

32-BIT LINUX REQUIREMENTS:

Most importantly:

* The time and inclination to fix issues #12 and #13 at
http://code.google.com/p/ironclad/issues/list (patches very very welcome).

Assuming you have the above, here follows everything else you should need:

* IronPython 2.0 release candidate 2 (2.0.0.0)
* gcc and make
* objdump
* nasm
* "recent" Mono (with gmcs compiler)
* Python 2.5, with -dev package

BUILDING

Ironclad's build process is configured by 'Makefile.config' in the top-
level directory. Change the value of variables NET, OS, and IPY_DIR 
appropriately.

Running make in the top-level directory should do the following:

* Run 'tools/generatepython25mapper.py' to create various files in 'src/' from 
  the contents of 'src/python25mappercomponents/'
* Run 'tools/generatepython25api.py' to create 'src/Python25Api.cs' from the 
  contents of 'src/python25apicomponents/'
* Run 'tools/generatedispatcher.py' to create various files in 'src/' from 
  various files in 'tools/' and 'stub/'
* Compile the contents of 'src/' to create 'build/ironclad/ironclad.dll'
* Run 'tools/buildstub.py' to (eventually) create the stub library 
  'build/ironclad/python25.dll' from an existing (real) python25.dll and the 
  contents of 'stub/'

At this point, the project is built and may even be usable. However, make will 
also build some test data, and run several tests; we expect all these to pass.

TESTING

You should ensure that IRONPYTHONPATH is set correctly. In particular, it
should include the directory containing .pyd files.

In order for all tests to run, numpy 1.2, scipy 0.7, and matplotlib 0.98 must 
be installed - but this is not otherwise necessary.

If the directory containing your numpy installation is on your sys.path, it
should be possible to run 'ipy tests\scipy\numpytests.py' from the top-level
directory, which will test numpy far more comprehensively than 
'tests/functionalitytest.py' can. To convince numpy's tests to run, nose must 
be installed, but will not actually be used.
